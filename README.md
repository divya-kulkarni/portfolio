## The Process

- I started by sketching out a general structure of how I wanted the website to look like.
- After implementing the basic structure, I decided to add scroll-based animations to add an element of interest to the landing page.
- I added a contact form and integrated it with EmailJS, which sends user's messages directly to my email address.
- Then, I added tests for each component using Testing Library.
- Finally, I added case studies for projects, making sure I include enough visual content that conveys my message.
- I used Git for version control, ensuring a smooth development workflow.

## Achievements and Outcomes

- The portfolio website has been successfully launched.
- I will be updating this section as I get more feedback from visitors and/or employers.

## What I learned

- One of the main challenges faced during development was achieving a balance between creativity and simplicity in the design.
- This was addressed through thorough research, user testing, and many design iterations.
- Additionally, optimising performance and ensuring compatibility across different browsers and devices posed technical challenges that were overcome through meticulous testing and optimisation techniques.

## What can be improved

- **Hosting:** I would like to host this website on a custom domain.
- **Immersiveness:** In the next version of the portfolio, I'd like the user to experience my world in 3D.
- **Performance:** During testing in Lighthouse, the website scored as follows:
  <img width="1433" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-10 at 4 22 46 PM" src="https://github.com/divya-kulkarni/portfolio/assets/44868354/87f1bf17-d349-465a-84d5-6c7d0b16cdff">
  I'd like to improve the scores and make it as optimised as possible, by implementing `lazy loading` and using `.webp` images.

## Installation and Execution
