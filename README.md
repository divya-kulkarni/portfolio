# Portfolio

My portfolio website serves as a `digital showcase` of my skills, experience, and projects. Designed with simplicity and elegance in mind, it provides visitors with a glimpse into my capabilities as a developer and a professional.

## TL;DR:

### Tech Stack
- ReactJS
- HTML
- CSS
- React Bootstrap

### Features:

- Project list
- Detailed case study for each project
- Contact form for seamless communication with visitors
- About Me page


## The Process:

- I started by sketching out a general structure of how I wanted the website to look like.
- After implementing the basic structure, I decided to add scroll-based animations to add an element of interest to the landing page.
- Finally, I added case studies for projects, making sure I include enough visual content that conveys my message.
- I used Git for version control, ensuring a smooth development workflow.


## Achievements and Outcomes:

- The portfolio website has been successfully launched.
- I will be updating this section as I get more feedback from visitors and/or employers.

## What I learned:

- One of the main challenges faced during development was achieving a balance between creativity and simplicity in the design.
- This was addressed through thorough research, user testing, and many design iterations.
- Additionally, optimising performance and ensuring compatibility across different browsers and devices posed technical challenges that were overcome through meticulous testing and optimisation techniques.

## What can be improved
- **Immersiveness:** In the next version of the portfolio, I'd like the user to experience my world in 3D.
- **Performance:** During testing in Lighthouse, the website scored as follows:
I'd like to improve the scores and make it as optimised as possible, by implementing `lazy loading` and using `.webp` images.
